# Full Stack E-Commerce Platform - Microservices Architecture Plan

## Project Overview
This project is a full-fledged **E-Commerce Platform** built using the **MERN stack** and **TypeScript**. The platform will leverage a **Microservices architecture**, enabling scalability and high performance across multiple services, including user authentication, product management, order processing, and payments.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express, TypeScript)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Clerk (for frontend authentication)
- **API Gateway**: Express/Fastify
- **Communication**: RabbitMQ / Kafka
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe / PayPal
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

---

## Microservices Breakdown
The platform will be built using multiple microservices:

1. **User Service**
   - Handles user registration, login, and session management.
   - Provides authentication middleware for API requests.

2. **Admin Service**
   - Admin control panel to manage users, products, orders, and more.
   
3. **Product Service**
   - CRUD operations for managing products.
   - Supports product listing, search, and filtering.

4. **Order Service**
   - Manages order creation, updates, and tracking.
   - Event-driven communication with other services for real-time updates.

5. **Payment Service**
   - Integrates with **Stripe/PayPal** to process payments securely.
   - Handles webhooks for payment confirmation and generates invoices.

6. **Notification Service**
   - Sends real-time email/SMS notifications for order updates and other important events.

---

## Service Communication

- **API Gateway**: Routes client requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)**: Ensures asynchronous communication between services, helping to scale efficiently.
- **Database Choice**: MongoDB for all services, allowing easy integration and storage.

## Development Plan

### **Week 1: Architecture Setup & Core Services**
- **Day 1**: Define architecture, set up repository, and documentation.
- **Day 2**: Set up API Gateway and establish communication between services (RabbitMQ/Kafka).
- **Day 3**: Develop **User Service** (registration, login, and authentication).
- **Day 4**: Develop **Admin Service** (admin control for users, products, orders).
- **Day 5**: Build **Product Service** (CRUD operations, product listing).
- **Day 6**: Develop **Order Service** (order creation, tracking).
- **Day 7**: Build **Payment Service** (Stripe/PayPal integration).

### **Week 2: Frontend Development & Integration**
- **Day 8**: Set up **React frontend** with ShadeCN UI.
- **Day 9**: Implement **authentication flow** using **Clerk**.
- **Day 10**: Integrate frontend with **Product Service** (displaying products).
- **Day 11**: Develop **cart functionality** and integrate **checkout process**.
- **Day 12**: Integrate frontend with **Order and Payment Services**.
- **Day 13**: Implement **user profile management** (view orders, settings).
- **Day 14**: Test and debug frontend-backend integration.

### **Week 3: Optimization, CI/CD, and Deployment**
- **Day 15**: Implement caching with **Redis** for improved performance.
- **Day 16**: Set up **CI/CD pipelines** with **GitHub Actions**.
- **Day 17**: Write **unit tests** and **integration tests** for all services.
- **Day 18**: Perform **security checks** and optimizations (e.g., rate limiting, JWT protection).
- **Day 19**: Finalize **Docker setup** for production deployment.
- **Day 20**: Deploy the application to cloud platforms like **AWS** or **Vercel**.
- **Day 21**: Conduct **final testing** and **project review**.

## Current Status
- Currently working on **User** and **Admin services**. More updates to come soon!

---

## Future Considerations
- Optimize platform performance using caching, load balancing, and microservice scaling.
- Ensure the application is secure with JWT authentication, SSL/TLS encryption, and secure payment processing.
