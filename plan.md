# E-Commerce Platform - Microservices Architecture (Final Mega Project)

## **1. Project Overview**
This e-commerce platform is a full-fledged **MERN stack** application using a **microservices** architecture. It will include authentication, product management, order processing, and payments, ensuring scalability and performance.

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express, TypeScript)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** Clerk
- **API Gateway:** Express/Fastify
- **Communication:** RabbitMQ / Kafka
- **Payment Integration:** Stripe / PayPal
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Deployment:** Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

## **2. Project Setup**

### **Backend Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ecommerce-platform.git
cd ecommerce-platform

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start services using Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```

### **Folder Structure**

## **3. Microservices Breakdown**

### **Auth Service (Clerk)**
- Handles user registration, login, and session management.
- Integrates Clerk for OAuth, passwordless, and social logins.
- Provides authentication middleware for API requests.

### **Product Service**
- CRUD operations for products.
- Supports search, filtering, and pagination.
- Uses MongoDB for product storage.

### **Order Service**
- Handles order creation, updates, and tracking.
- Uses event-driven communication with other services.

### **Payment Service (Stripe/PayPal)**
- Processes payments securely.
- Handles webhooks for payment confirmation.
- Generates invoices and transaction logs.

### **User Service**
- Manages user profiles, addresses, and order history.
- Connects with Clerk for authentication verification.

### **Notification Service**
- Sends email/SMS notifications.
- Uses event-driven architecture for real-time alerts.

## **4. Communication Between Services**
- **API Gateway:** Routes client requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka):** Ensures asynchronous communication between services.
- **Database Choice:** MongoDB for all services.

## **5. Deployment**

### **Docker Setup**
```bash
# Build and run all services
docker-compose up --build
```

### **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**
- Automates build, test, and deployment.
- Uses GitHub Actions workflows.

## **6. Daily Development Plan**

### **Week 1: Project Initialization & Architecture Setup**
- **Day 1:** Define architecture, create repository, and set up documentation.
- **Day 2:** Set up API Gateway and service communication (RabbitMQ/Kafka).
- **Day 3:** Authentication and user service.
- **Day 4:** Develop the product service (CRUD operations).
- **Day 5:** Develop the order service (Order creation, tracking).
- **Day 6:** Develop the payment service (Stripe/PayPal integration).
- **Day 7:** Implement notification service for emails/SMS.

### **Week 2: Frontend & Integration**
- **Day 8:** Set up Next.js/React frontend with Tailwind CSS.
- **Day 9:** Implement authentication flow using Clerk.
- **Day 10:** Connect frontend with the product service.
- **Day 11:** Implement cart functionality and checkout process.
- **Day 12:** Connect frontend with order and payment services.
- **Day 13:** Implement user profile management.
- **Day 14:** Test and debug frontend-backend integration.

### **Week 3: Optimization & Deployment**
- **Day 15:** Implement caching with Redis for improved performance.
- **Day 16:** Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- **Day 17:** Write unit and integration tests.
- **Day 18:** Perform security checks and optimizations.
- **Day 19:** Finalize Docker setup for production.
- **Day 20:** Deploy the application to cloud platforms (AWS, Vercel, etc.).
- **Day 21:** Conduct final testing and project review.
